This repository is used by the SharedInstallEnd2End test.
It contains two dummy bundles installable by two dummy features. Those are just used to install content into the base or the user install.
It also contains the code of the p2 verifier bundle wrapped by a feature to make it easily installable. 

The source code is available in the folder called source sibling of the folder containing this file.

Detailed instructions how to build the repository are located next to the test source,
in a README.txt file located in bundles/org.eclipse.equinox.p2.tests/src/org/eclipse/equinox/p2/tests/sharedinstall/.
