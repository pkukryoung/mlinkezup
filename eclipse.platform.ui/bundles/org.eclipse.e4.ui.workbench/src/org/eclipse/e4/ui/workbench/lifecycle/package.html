Application programming interfaces describing the Eclipse 4 lifecycle annotations.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
<p>
The package provides annotations that can be used in a lifecycle class. A product can provide a lifecycle manager object. An instance of this object will be created and called into by E4AP using a set of annotated methods. The lifecycle manager class is provided as a URI either using the "lifeCycleURI" product property or from the "-lifeCycleURI" command-line argument; only a single lifecycle manager is supported at present. The lifecycle manager is created on the application context.
</p>
<p>
Currently supported annotations are those in org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.lifecycle:
</p>
<ul>
<li>PostContextCreate: called after the application context has been created, but prior to the model having been loaded</li>
<li>ProcessAdditions: called once the application model is loaded.</li>
<li>ProcessRemovals: called after ProcessAdditions</li>
<li>PreSave: called before the model is persisted</li>
</ul>
</body>
