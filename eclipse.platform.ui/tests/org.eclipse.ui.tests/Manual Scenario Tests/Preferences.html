   <title>Test Scenario: Preferences</title>
</head>
<body>

<h3>
Preferences</h3>
Purpose: To test the Preferences in Eclipse.&nbsp; We will open the Preferences
dialog, select some pages, change and apply preferences, verify their affect,
and test persistence between sessions.
<p>Setup:
<ol>
<li>
Install Eclipse Platform.</li>
</ol>
Method:
<ol>
<li>
Start the workbench.</li>

<li>
Invoke Window > Preferences and verify that the Preferences dialog appears.&nbsp;
Click on all of the items in the left hand viewer to demonstrate that each
item has a valid page and no exceptions occur in their creation.&nbsp;
Now close the dialog.</li>

<li>
The behavior of the workbench can be customized using the preferences.&nbsp;
To see this in action we will examine various preferences which ship with
Eclipse.</li>

<li>
The selection in the navigator is linked to the active editor.&nbsp; Open
a couple of files.&nbsp; Then switch between the editors and watch how
the input for the active editor is selected in the navigator.&nbsp; You
can disable this option in the Preferences.&nbsp; To do this ..</li>

<ol>
<li>
Open the preferences dialog.</li>

<li>
Turning off "Link navigator selection to active editor" in the workbench
preferences.</li>

<li>
Press OK.&nbsp; The dialog should close.</li>

<li>
Now switch between the editors.&nbsp; Notice that the selection in the
navigator does not change.</li>
</ol>

<li>
The Perspective > Open menu action can also be customized.&nbsp; By default
this action will open a new perspective in the current window.&nbsp; You
can change this to "open in new window" or "replace other".&nbsp; To see
this behavior ..</li>

<ol>
<li>
Open the preferences dialog.&nbsp; Change the workbench preferences for
"Open Perspective" to "Open in New Window".&nbsp; Then press OK</li>

<li>
Invoke Perspective > Open > Java.&nbsp; Notice how a new window is created
for the perspective.&nbsp; The list of open windows is shown in the Window
menu.&nbsp; Select these items to switch between the windows.</li>
</ol>

<li>
If you don't like the current preferences you can reset them.&nbsp; Open
the preferences dialog again.&nbsp; To reset the state of "Link navigator
.." and "Open Perspective .." press the Restore Defaults button.&nbsp;
If you press OK the options will be saved.&nbsp; However, let's assume
that you decide not to change them.&nbsp; Press Cancel.&nbsp; Then verify
that the deviant options have not been restored to default by switching
between editors and opening a new perspective.</li>

<li>
Invoke File > Exit.&nbsp; Then restart the workbench.</li>

<li>
Open the preferences dialog and confirm tha "Link navigator .. " and "Open
Perspective .." still reflect the customized values.&nbsp; The workbench
will automatically save your preferences between sessions.</li>
</ol>
