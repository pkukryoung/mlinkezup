<h3>
Persistence</h3>
Purpose: To test persistence in the workbench.
<p>Setup:
<ol>
<li>
Install Eclipse Platform.</li>

<li>
Delete the metadata for org.eclipse.ui.</li>
</ol>
Method:
<ol>
<li>
Start the workbench.&nbsp; Confirm that the default perspective (Resource)
and welcome editor both appear.</li>

<li>
Create a project with 3 files, one.txt, two.txt, and three.txt.&nbsp; Open
one.txt in the default perspective.</li>

<li>
In the navigator select the project and invoke Open Perspective > Java
from the context menu.&nbsp; Verify that a new Java perspective appears
in the current window.&nbsp; The input for the Packages view and navigator
should be the project.</li>

<li>
Open two.txt in the Java perspective.</li>

<li>
Change the Workbench Preferences for "Open Perspective" to "Open in New
Window".&nbsp; Then open a Java perspective and verify that a new window
is created.</li>

<li>
Now we have two windows.&nbsp; The first window has two perspectives (resource
and java).&nbsp; In the resource perspective one.txt is open in an editor.&nbsp;
In the java perspective two.txt is open in an editor.&nbsp; In the second
window here is one Java perspective with no open editors.</li>

<li>
Invoke File > Exit.&nbsp; Then restart the workbench and verify that the
window, perspective and editor state of the workbench is restored.</li>
</ol>
