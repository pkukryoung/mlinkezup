<li>
Open an editor on a java file. Verify that a java page appears in the outline
view.&nbsp; If you select items in this page the scroll and selected text
within the editor should change.</li>

<li>
Open a second file in a java editor.&nbsp; Verify that a second java page
appears in the outline view.</li>

<li>

Open a .txt file in a text editor.&nbsp; When this editor is active the
outline view will be empty and contain the standard empty text as described
