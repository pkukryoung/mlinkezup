This is a test script for the properties dialog.

Presentation
	Verify that the listbox on the left shows appropriate scrollbars 
		when its contents extends beyond its client area.
	Verify that the window grows to fit the content page of the 
		selected item.
	Verify that you can traverse all widget groups by pressing TAB.
	Verify that the title bar shows the name of the resource about 
		which the dialog shows information.

Actions
	Clicking on a item that contributes in the tree shows the 
		corresponding page on the right, including the page title.

		the default page on the right.

			Team page should show the default page.
